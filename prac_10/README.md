1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, 
how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? 
What did you learn from doing the estimates?

Due to factors like task complexity, familiarity with the technologies involved, 
and unforeseen challenges, estimates started out with varying degrees of accuracy. 
Accuracy increased with time as patterns developed and more experience was gained.

Also, by estimating tasks, I improved ability to evaluate complexity, 
divide tasks into smaller parts, and foresee possible roadblocks. 
Gradually improving estimation skills were achieved by thinking back on previous estimates 
and contrasting them with actual time spent.

2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

By reviewing codes,i got important insights into enhancing its quality, 
comprehending optimal procedures, and gaining knowledge from the experiences of others. 
It assisted in pinpointing regions in need of development and blind spots.

3. Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of the course, I might think about include more practical tasks, 
possibilities for peer cooperation, and simulations of actual projects. 
Furthermore, giving constant direction and comments during the assignments might 
improve the learning process. Providing students with a diverse range of project 
possibilities that address their interests and ability levels could further enhance 
their educational experience.
